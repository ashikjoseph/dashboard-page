                        Performance Overview:

                        Welcome to the Performance Overview section of the admin panel. Here, you can monitor and analyze various aspects of the system's performance to ensure optimal functionality and user experience. We provide detailed insights into key performance indicators, allowing you to make informed decisions and take necessary actions to maintain high performance standards.

                        Key Metrics:

                        Response Time: Track the average response time of the system to user requests. A lower response time indicates better performance and responsiveness.
                        Server Load: Monitor the server's load to ensure it remains within acceptable limits. High server loads can lead to slower response times and potential system failures.
                        Error Rate: Keep an eye on the error rate to identify any issues or bugs affecting the system's performance. Minimizing errors enhances user satisfaction and trust in the platform.
                        Database Queries: Analyze the efficiency of database queries to optimize performance. Slow or inefficient queries can bottleneck the system and degrade performance.
